<h2>Trouble</br>
Blood is in the rocky waters</br>
Hide away your sons and daughters</br>
Eat you alive</br>
Levels</br>
Better put your head on swivels</br>
Dancing with the very devil</br>
Butter to knife</br></br>
You think you're better than them</br>
Better than them</br>
You think they're really your friends</br>
Really your friends</br>
But when it comes to the end</br>
To the end</br>
You're just the same as them</br>
Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)</br></br>
So let it go, let it go</br>
That's the way that it goes</br>
First you're in, then you're out</br>
Everybody knows</br>
You're hot, then you're cold</br>
You're a light in the dark</br>
Just you wait and you'll see</br>
That you're swimmin' with sharks</br></br>
He's comin' to get you</br>
(Chick, chicka) Woo, woo</br>
He's comin' to get you, get</br>
(Chicka) Woo</br>
Bubbles</br>
Drownin', you're seein' doubles</br>
Don't you let 'em see your struggles</br>
Hiding your tears</br></br>
Crisis</br>
Take advantage off your niceness</br>
Cut you up in even slices</br>
Prey on your fears</br>
You think you're better than them</br>
Better than them (you think you're better)</br>
You think they're really your friends</br>
Really your friends (really)</br></br>
But when it comes to the end</br>
To the end (oh, no)</br>
You're just the same as them</br>
Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)</br>
So let it go, let it go</br>
That's the way that it goes</br>
First you're in, then you're out</br>
Everybody knows (ooh)</br></br>
You're hot, then you're cold</br>
You're a light in the dark</br>
Just you wait and you'll see</br>
That you're swimmin' with sharks</br>
He's comin' to get you</br>
(Don't take it from me) Woo, woo</br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get</br>
(Don't take it from me)</br></br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you</br>
(Don't take it from me) Woo, woo</br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get</br>
(Don't take it from me)</br>
Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe</br>
I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy</br>
My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me</br>
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything</br></br>
(Sharks)</br>
Don't take it from me</br>
My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks)</br>
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything</br></br>
So let it go, let it go</br>
That's the way that it goes</br>
First you're in, then you're out</br>
Everybody knows</br></br>
You're hot, then you're cold</br>
You're a light in the dark</br>
Just you wait and you'll see</br>
That you're swimmin' with sharks</br></br>
He's comin' to get you</br>
(Don't take it from me) Woo, woo</br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get</br>
(Don't take it from me)</br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you</br>
(Don't take it from me) Woo, woo</br>
(My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get</br>
